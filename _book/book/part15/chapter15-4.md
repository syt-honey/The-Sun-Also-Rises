In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing. 

The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated. 

They all looked down while they danced. 

Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. 

The toes touched. The heels touched. 

The balls of the feet touched. 

Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street. 

"Here come the gentry," Bill said. 

They were crossing the street. 

"Hello, men," I said. 

"Hello, gents !" said Brett. "You saved us seats? How nice." 

"I say," Mike said, "that Romero what'shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?" 

"Oh, isn't he lovely," Brett said. "And those green trousers." 

"Brett never took her eyes off them." 

"I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow." 

"How did it go?" 

"Wonderfully ! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle !" 

"How about the horses?" 

"I couldn't help looking at them." 

"She couldn't take her eyes off them," Mike said. "She's an extraordinary wench." 

"They do have some rather awful things happen to them," Brett said. "I couldn't look away, though." 

"Did you feel all right?" 

"I didn't feel badly at all." 

"Robert Cohn did," Mike put in. "You were quite green, Robert." 

"The first horse did bother me," Cohn said. 

"You weren't bored, were you?" asked Bill. 

Cohn laughed. 

"No. I wasn't bored. I wish you'd forgive me that." 

"It's all right," Bill said, "so long as you weren't bored." 

"He didn't look bored," Mike said. "I thought he was going to be sick." 

"I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute." 

"I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, Robert?" 

"Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it." 

"He was, you know. He was positively green." 

"Oh, shove it along, Michael." 

"You mustn't ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert," Mike said. "It might make such a mess." 

"Oh, shove it along, Michael," Brett said. 

"He said Brett was a sadist," Mike said. "Brett's not a sadist. She's just a lovely, healthy wench." 

"Are you a sadist, Brett?" I asked. "Hope not." 

"He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach." 

"Won't be healthy long." 

Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses. 

"Did you really like it?" Bill asked Cohn. 

"No, I can't say I liked it. I think it's a wonderful show." 

"Gad, yes ! What a spectacle !" Brett said. 

"I wish they didn't have the horse part," Cohn said. 

"They're not important," Bill said. "After a while you never notice anything disgusting." 

"It is a bit strong just at the start," Brett said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse." 

"The bulls were fine," Cohn said. 

"They were very good," Mike said. 

"I want to sit down below, next time." Brett drank from her glass of absinthe. 

"She wants to see the bull-fighters close by," Mike said. 

"They are something," Brett said. "That Romero lad is just a child." 

"He's a damned good-looking boy," I said. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid." 

"How old do you suppose he is?" 

"Nineteen or twenty." 

"Just imagine it." 

The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. 

Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. 

Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. 

No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians.It was all Romero. 

There were two other matadors, but they did not count. 

I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. 

I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. 

I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. 

She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. 

She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. 

She saw why she liked Romero's cape-work and why she did not like the others. 

Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. 

The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. 

Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. 

Romero's bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. 

He did not have to emphasize their closeness. 

Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. 

I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technique that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. 

Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing. 

"I've never seen him do an awkward thing," Brett said. 

"You won't until he gets frightened," I said. 

"He'll never be frightened," Mike said. "He knows too damned much." 

"He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with." 

"And God, what looks," Brett said. 

"I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bullfighter chap," Mike said. 

"I wouldn't be surprised." 

"Be a good chap, Jake. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers." 

"Tell me what drunks they are." 

"Oh, frightful," Mike said. "Drunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers." 

"He looks that way," Brett said. 

"Doesn't he?" I said. 

They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked,the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate. 

"This next is the last one." 

"Not really," Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out. 

After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd. 

"These bull-fights are hell on one," Brett said. "I'm limp as a rag." 

"Oh, you'll get a drink," Mike said. 

The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. 

It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. 

The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.
