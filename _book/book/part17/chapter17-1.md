Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. 

Edna was the girl's name. 

"We've been thrown out," Edna said. 

"By the police," said Mike. "There's some people in there that don't like me." 

"I've kept them out of four fights," Edna said. "You've got to help me." 

Bill's face was red. 

"Come back in, Edna," he said. "Go on in there and dance with Mike." 

"It's silly," Edna said. "There'll just be another row." 

"Damned Biarritz swine," Bill said. 

"Come on," Mike said. "After all, it's a pub. They can't occupy a whole pub." 

"Good old Mike," Bill said. "Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta." 

"They're so bloody," Mike said. "I hate the English." 

"They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow. They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke. 

"Who cares?" Mike said. "I don't care. Jake doesn't care. Do you care?" 

"No," Edna said. "Are you a bankrupt?" 

"Of course I am. You don't care, do you, Bill?" 

Bill put his arm around Mike's shoulder. 

"I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I'd show those bastards." 

"They're just English," Mike said. "It never makes any difference what the English say." 

"The dirty swine," Bill said. "I'm going to clean them out." 

"Bill," Edna looked at me. "Please don't go in again, Bill. 

They're so stupid." 

"That's it," said Mike. "They're stupid. I knew that was what it was." 

"They can't say things like that about Mike," Bill said. 

"Do you know them?" I asked Mike. 

"No. I never saw them. They say they know me." 

"I won't stand it," Bill said. 

"Come on. Let's go over to the Suizo," I said. 

"They're a bunch of Edna's friends from Biarritz," Bill said. 

"They're simply stupid," Edna said. 

"One of them's Charley Blackman, from Chicago," Bill said. 

"I was never in Chicago," Mike said. 

Edna started to laugh and could not stop. 

"Take me away from here," she said, "you bankrupts." 

"What kind of a row was it?" I asked Edna. 

We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone. 

"I don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What's the matter with Mike?" 

"Probably he owes them money," I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about." 

In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting. 

They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them. 

They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. 

The night was clearing and the moon was out. 

Some of the people in the line were sleeping. 

At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up. 

"Where's Brett?" he asked. 

"I don't know." 

"She was with you." 

"She must have gone to bed." 

"She's not." 

"I don't know where she is." 

His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up. 

"Tell me where she is." 

"Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is." 

"The hell you don't !" 

"You can shut your face." 

"Tell me where Brett is." 

"I'll not tell you a damn thing." 

"You know where she is." 

"If I did I wouldn't tell you." 

"Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table. 

"Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They're on their honeymoon." 

"You shut up." 

"Oh, go to hell !" Mike said languidly. 

"Is that where she is?" Cohn turned to me. 

"Go to hell !" 

"She was with you. Is that where she is?" 

"Go to hell !" 

"I'll make you tell me" — he stepped forward — "you damned pimp." 

I swung at him and he ducked. 

I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. 

As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. 

I went down backward under a table. 

I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. 

I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. 

Mike helped me up. 

Some one poured a carafe of water on my head. 

Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair. 

Mike was pulling at my ears. 

"I say, you were cold," Mike said. 

"Where the hell were you?" 

"Oh, I was around." 

"You didn't want to mix in it?" 

"He knocked Mike down, too," Edna said. 

"He didn't knock me out," Mike said. "I just lay there." 

"Does this happen every night at your fiestas?" Edna asked. "Wasn't that Mr. Cohn?" 

"I'm all right," I said. "My head's a little wobbly." 

There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around. 

"Vaya (西语，滚开) !" said Mike. "Get away. Go on." 

The waiters moved the people away. 

"It was quite a thing to watch," Edna said. "He must be a boxer." 

"He is." 

"I wish Bill had been here," Edna said. "I'd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I've always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He's so big." 

"I was hoping he would knock down a waiter," Mike said, "and get arrested. I'd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail." 

"No," I said. 

"Oh, no," said Edna. "You don't mean that." 

"I do, though," Mike said. "I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. 

I never play games, even." 

Mike took a drink. 

"I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?" 

"All right." 

"You're nice," Edna said to Mike. "Are you really a bankrupt?" 

"I'm a tremendous bankrupt," Mike said. "I owe money to everybody. Don't you owe any money?" 

"Tons." 

"I owe everybody money," Mike said. "I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night." 

"The hell you did," I said. 

"I'll pay it back," Mike said. "I always pay everything back." 

"That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" Edna said. 

I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. 

It all seemed like some bad play. 

"I'm going over to the hotel," I said. 

Then I heard them talking about me. 

"Is he all right?" Edna asked. 

"We'd better walk with him." 

"I'm all right," I said. "Don't come. I'll see you all later." 

I walked away from the café. 

They were sitting at the table. 

I looked back at them and at the empty tables. 

There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands. 

Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed. 

I had never seen the trees before. 

I had never seen the flagpoles before,nor the front of the theatre. 

It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. 

I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new. 

They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. 

Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away. 

I had been kicked in the head early in the game. 

It was like that crossing the square. 
It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. 

Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. 

There was a light in the room. 

Bill came out and met me in the hall. 

"Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you." 

"The hell with him." 

"Go on. Go on up and see him." 

I did not want to climb another flight of stairs. 

"What are you looking at me that way for?" 

"I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape." 

"You were drunk a little while ago," I said. 

"I'm drunk now," Bill said. "But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you." 

"All right," I said. 

It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. 

I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. 

I walked down the hall to Cohn's room. 

The door was shut and I knocked. 

"Who is it?" 

"Barnes." 

"Come in, Jake." 

I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. 

There was no light in the room. 

Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.
