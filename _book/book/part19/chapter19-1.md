In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. 

I woke about nine o'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. 

The square was empty and there were no people on the streets. 

A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square. 

The caf√©s were just opening and the waiters were carrying Out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade. 

They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose. 

I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. 

The waiter was in no hurry to come. 

The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade. 

A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone. 

The fiesta was over. I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. 

I watched him come walking across the square. 

He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee. 

"Well," he said, "it's all over." 

"Yes," I said. "When do you go?" 

"I don't know. We better get a car, I think. Aren't you going back to Paris?" 

"No. I can stay away another week. I think I'll go to San Sebastian." 

"I want to get back." 

"What's Mike going to do?" 

"He's going to Saint Jean de Luz." 

"Let's get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night." 

"Good. Let's go after lunch." 

"All right. I'll get the car." 

We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. 

One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside. 

The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in. 

The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona. 

It did not seem like a very long ride. 

Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. 

We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. 

We left Bill's baggage at the station,and he bought a ticket to Paris. 

His train left at seven-ten. We came out of the station. 

The car was standing out in front. 

"What shall we do about the car?" Bill asked. 

"Oh, bother the car," Mike said. "Let's just keep the car with us." 

"All right," Bill said. "Where shall we go?" 

"Let's go to Biarritz and have a drink." 

"Old Mike the spender," Bill said. 

We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. 

We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda. 

"That drink's mine," Mike said. 

"Let's roll for it." 

So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. 

Bill was out first roll. 

Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note. 

The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. 

We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. 

In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. 

It was a pleasant bar. We had another round. 

I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled. 

Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second. 

On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. 

He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace and a queen. 

"It's yours, Mike," Bill said. "Old Mike, the gambler." 

"I'm so sorry," Mike said. "I can't get it." 

"What's the matter?" 

"I've no money," Mike said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs." 

Bill's face sort of changed. 

"I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too." 

"I'll cash you a check," Bill said. 

"That's damned nice of you, but you see I can't write checks." 

"What are you going to do for money?" 

"Oh, some will come through. I've two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean." 

"What do you want to do about the car?" Bill asked me. "Do you want to keep it on?" 

"It doesn't make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic." 

"Come on, let's have another drink," Mike said. 

"Fine. This one is on me," Bill said. "Has Brett any money?" He turned to Mike. 

"I shouldn't think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya." 

"She hasn't any money with her?" I asked. 

"I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews." 

"I suppose they get it at the source," said Bill. 

"Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen,I believe." 

"Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked. 

"I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left." 

"Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink." 

"Damned good idea," Mike said. "One never gets anywhere by discussing finances." 

"No," said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. 

Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car. 

"Anywhere you'd like to go, Mike?" Bill asked. 

"Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little." 

"Fine. I'd like to see the coast. Let's drive down toward Hendaye." 

"I haven't any credit along the coast." 

"You can't ever tell," said Bill. 

We drove out along the coast road. 

There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. 

We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. 

Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. 

The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. 

It was time for us to go back. 

He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. 

The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. 

In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea. 

At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. 

The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car. 

"Good-bye, you chaps," Mike said. "It was a damned fine fiesta." 

"So long, Mike," Bill said. 

"I'll see you around," I said. 

"Don't worry about money," Mike said. "You can pay for the car, Jake, and I'll send you my share." 

"So long, Mike." 

"So long, you chaps. You've been damned nice." 

We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. 

He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. 

A porter carried Bill's bags in from the consigne. 

I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks. 

"So long, fella," Bill said. 

"So long, kid !" 

"It was swell. I've had a swell time." 

"Will you be in Paris?" 

"No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella !" 

"So long, old kid !" 

He went in through the gate to the train. 

The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. 

Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. 

I went outside to the car. "How much do we owe you?" I asked the driver. 

The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas. 

"Two hundred pesetas." 

"How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?" 

"Fifty pesetas." 

"Don't kid me." 

"Thirty-five pesetas." 

"It's not worth it," I said. "Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri." 

At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. 

The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. 

It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. 

The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. 

I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. 

I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. 

It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. 

That seemed a very long time ago. 

I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.
