We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on. 

I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back. 

We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill. 

We walked across the fields on the sandy path. 

The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing. 

The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods. 

The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. 

The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail. 

In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. 

We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. 

Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising. 

Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. 

A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. 

The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods. 

It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. 

Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. 

We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. 

The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. 

There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park. 

"This is country," Bill said. 

The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. 

Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. 

All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. 

Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. 

We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. 

There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees. 

Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. 

The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. 

Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River (伊拉蒂河). 

"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill. 

"That's a hell of a hike." 

"It's too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably." 

"Comfortably. That's a nice word. We'll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all." 

It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica (法布里卡河谷). 

The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. 

Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. 

There was a field of buckwheat on the hill. 

We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside. 

It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river. 

Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish. 

"You're sure this thing has trout in it?" Bill asked. 

"It's full of them." 

"I'm going to fish a fly (飞蝇钓法). You got any McGintys (一款假蝇钩)?" 

"There's some in there." 

"You going to fish bait?" 

"Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here." 

"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. 

"Where'd I better go? Up or down?" 

"Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too." 

Bill went down the bank. 

"Take a worm can." 

"No, I don't want one. If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around." 

Bill was down below watching the stream. 

"Say," he called up against the noise of the dam. 

"How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?" 

"All right," I shouted. 

Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. 

I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. 

There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. 

It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. 

I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine. 

I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. 

It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. 

The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. 

In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. 

As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down. 

Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down. 

I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam. 

I did not feel the first trout strike. 

When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam. 

He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag. 

While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. 

As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way. 

In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size. 

I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them. 

They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water. 

It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. 

I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of ferns, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. 

They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree. 

It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.
