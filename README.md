# Introduction

This is an original book of English that I am studying. Now I want to share it as a document with a handout for study. I hope it will help you.

Here are a few points to pay attention to in reading this book:

1. This book is for study only, if it involves any form of business, the consequences are at your own expense.
2. All the contents of the book come from the courses I attended.(DiDa Reading)
3. I will update this content on a regular basis,if there are any problems can be sent to me issues.

Finally, take your time~

tip: This platform currently has three original books, they are as follows: [How to win friends and influence people](https://syt-honey.github.io/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People/), [The great gatsby](https://syt-honey.github.io/The-Great-Gatsby), [The sun also rises](https://syt-honey.github.io/The-Sun-Also-Rises)
