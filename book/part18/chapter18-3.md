It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. 

Belmonte was no longer well enough. 

He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. 

He was not sure that there were any great moments. 

Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. 

He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence,looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. 

So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. 

It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more. 

Pedro Romero had the greatness. 

He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. 

Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. 

Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. 

Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. 

But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. 

He gained by it all through the afternoon. 

His first "quite" was directly below us. 

The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. 

Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. 

The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. 

The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. 

The bull was watching. 

Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. 

Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. 

Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull's eye. 

The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse. 

And a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte. 

The bull did not insist under the iron. 

He did not really want to get at the horse. 

He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. 

He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. 

The bull's tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. 

The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. 

At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. 

Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero's cape filled again, this time on the other side. 

Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. 

It was all so slow and so controlled. 

It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. 

He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away. 

In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. 

After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. 

He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. 

It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. 


They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced. 

"Why don't they change him?" Brett asked. 

"They've paid for him. They don't want to lose their money." 

"It's hardly fair to Romero." 

"Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color." 

"It's the sort of thing I don't like to see." 

It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. 

With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. 

He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. 

The Biarritz crowd did not like it. 

They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the flannel. 

They preferred Belmonte's imitation of himself or Marcial's imitation of Belmonte. 

There were three of them in the row behind us. 

"What's he afraid of the bull for? The bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth." 

"He's just a young bull-fighter. He hasn't learned it yet." 

"But I thought he was fine with the cape before." 

"Probably he's nervous now." 

Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer. 

The bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with that little, almost imperceptible（几乎察觉不到的）, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts. 

"He's going to kill now," I said to Brett. 

"The bull's still strong. He wouldn't wear himself out." 

Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. 

The bull charged as Romero charged. 

Romero's left hand dropped the muleta over the bull's muzzle to blind him. 

His left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one. 

Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders. 

Then the figure was broken. 

There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull. 

His shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling. 

"There he goes," Bill said. 

Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. 

His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. 

The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air. 

They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta. 

"Bad one," said the sword-handler. 

"He made me sweat," said Romero. 

He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. 

Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us. 

Marcial had a big day. 

They were still applauding him when Romero's last bull came in. 

It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running. 

During Romero's first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. 

Everything he did showed it. 

All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. 

The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. 

He was wiping all that out now. 

Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. 

It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. 

He was what Romero wanted in bulls.
