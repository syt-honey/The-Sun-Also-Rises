At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. 

We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. 

Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. 

They brought people for the bullfight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. 

There was one with twenty-five English women in it. 

They sat in the white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. 

The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta. 

The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. 

When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. 

You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. 

The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. 

All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. 

Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other's shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing. 

"Here comes Brett," Bill said. 

I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing. 

"Hello, you chaps !" she said. "I say,I have a thirst." 

"Get another big beer," Bill said to the waiter. 

"Shrimps?" 

"Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked. 

"Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car." 

The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook
She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip. 

"Good beer." 

"Very good," I said. I was nervous about Mike. 

I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control. 

"I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake," Brett said. 

"No. Knocked me out. That was all." 

"I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero," Brett said. "He hurt him most badly." 

"How is he?" 

"He'll be all right. He won't go out of the room." 

"Does he look badly?" 

"Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute." 

"Is he going to fight?" 

"Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind." 

"How's your boy friend?" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said. 

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," he said. "She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly." 

Brett stood up. "I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael." 

"How's your boy friend?" 

"Damned well," Brett said. "Watch him this afternoon." 

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "A beautiful, bloody bullfighter." 

"Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake." 

"Tell him all about your bull-fighter," Mike said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter !" 

He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash. 

"Come on," Brett said. "Let's get out of this." 

In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?" 

"I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. 

"His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says." 

Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright. 

"I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake." 

"Anything you want me to do?" 

"No, just go to the fight with me." 

"We'll see you at lunch?" 

"No. I'm eating with him." 

We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. 

They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade. 

"Want to take a turn out to the park?" Brett asked. "I don't want to go up yet. I fancy he's sleeping." 

We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. 

We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate (萨拉萨特大道). 

We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. 

They were making the turn at the upper end of the park. 

"Don't let's go there," Brett said. "I don't want staring at just now." 

We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea. 

"I hope the wind goes down," Brett said. "It's very bad for him." 

"So do I." 

"He says the bulls are all right." 

"They're good." 

"Is that San Fermin's?" Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel. 

"Yes. Where the show started on Sunday." 

"Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something." 

We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. 

It was dark inside. Many people were praying. 

You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. 

We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. 

After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead. 

"Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous." 

Outside in the hot brightness of the Street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. 

The praying had not been much of a success. 

"Don't know why I get so nervy in church," Brett said. "Never does me any good." 

We walked along. 

"I'm damned bad for a religious atmosphere," Brett said. "I've the wrong type of face." 

"You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him." 

"Good." 

"I wish the wind would drop, though." 

"It's liable to go down by five o'clock." 

"Let's hope." 

"You might pray," I laughed. 

"Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?" 

"Oh, yes." 

"Oh, rot," said Brett. "Maybe it works for some people, though you don't look very religious, Jake." 

"I'm pretty religious." 

"Oh, rot," said Brett. "Don't start proselyting to-day. To-day's going to be bad enough as it is." 

It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. 

We were back again in front of the hotel. 

All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating. 

"Do look after Mike," Brett said. "Don't let him get too bad." 

"Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German maître d’hôtel said in English. 

He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him: "Thank you so much. Have you anything else to say?" 

"No, ma'am." 

"Good," said Brett. 

"Save us a table for three," I said to the German. 

He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile. 

"Iss madam eating here?" 

"No, Brett said." 

"Den I think a table for two will be enuff." 

"Don't talk to him," Brett said. 

"Mike must have been in bad shape," she said on the stairs. 

We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile. 

"I'll see you at the café," Brett said. "Thank you, so much, Jake." 

We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. 

She went straight down the hail and into Romero's room. She did not knock. 

She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her. 

I stood in front of the door of Mike's room and knocked. There was no answer. 

I tried the knob and it opened. 

Inside the room was in great disorder. 

All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. 

There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. 

He opened his eyes and looked at me. 

"Hello, Jake," he said very slowly. 

"I'm getting a little sleep. I've want ed a little sleep for a long time." 

"Let me cover you over." 

"No. I'm quite warm." 

"Let's go and eat." 

"Don't go. I haven't got the sleep yet." 

"I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. 

"You'll sleep, Mike. Don't worry, boy." 

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "But her Jew has gone away." 

He turned his head and looked at me. "Damned good thing, what?" 

"Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep." 

"I'm just starting. I'm going to get a littie sleep." 

He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door quietly. 

Bill was in my room reading the paper. 

"See Mike?" 

"Yes." 

He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs." 

"He was snotty to us, too." 

We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray. 

"There goes Brett's lunch," Bill said. 

"And the kid's," I said. 

Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. 

His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite. 

"I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said. 

"Go sit at it," Bill said. We went on out across the street.
