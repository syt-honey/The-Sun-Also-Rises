                                <p>It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete (&#x5E03;&#x5C14;&#x6208;&#x7279;). </p>
<p>People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. </p>
<p>Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. </p>
<p>When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. </p>
<p>It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top. </p>
<p>Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. </p>
<p>A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. </p>
<p>He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. </p>
<p>He apologized and made me take another drink. </p>
<p>He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. </p>
<p>He was very good at it. The Basques (&#x5DF4;&#x65AF;&#x514B;&#x4EBA;) liked it. </p>
<p>The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. </p>
<p>The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. </p>
<p>When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. </p>
<p>Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. </p>
<p>They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills. </p>
<p>Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. </p>
<p>As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. </p>
<p>The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. </p>
<p>The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. </p>
<p>He nodded his head. &quot;Pretty nice, eh?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;These Basques are swell people,&quot; Bill said. </p>
<p>The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddleleather. </p>
<p>He wore a black smock like all the rest. </p>
<p>There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. </p>
<p>He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. </p>
<p>The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. </p>
<p>He shoved the wine-bag up. &quot;Arriba! Arriba! (&#x897F;&#x8BED;&#xFF0C;&#x4E3E;&#x8D77;&#x6765;&#xFF01;)&quot; he said. &quot;Lift it up.&quot; </p>
<p>Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. </p>
<p>When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin. </p>
<p>&quot;No! No!&quot; several Basques said. &quot;Not like that.&quot; </p>
<p>One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. </p>
<p>He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms&apos; length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. </p>
<p>He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; the owner of the bottle shouted. &quot;Whose wine is that?&quot; </p>
<p>The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. </p>
<p>Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. </p>
<p>He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly. </p>
<p>We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. </p>
<p>Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. </p>
<p>We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. </p>
<p>The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. </p>
<p>The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. </p>
<p>The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. </p>
<p>Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. </p>
<p>We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. </p>
<p>The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. </p>
<p>Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. </p>
<p>This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero (&#x897F;&#x8BED;&#xFF0C;&#x8D76;&#x9AA1;&#x4EBA;) driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. </p>
<p>Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain. </p>
<p>We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. </p>
<p>A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses. </p>
<p>The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. </p>
<p>Bill and I got down and went into the posada. </p>
<p>There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, </p>
<p>and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. </p>
<p>It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. </p>
<p>Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods. </p>
<p>We each had an aguardiente (&#x571F;&#x917F;&#x767D;&#x5170;&#x5730;) and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. </p>
<p>I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price. </p>
<p>Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. </p>
<p>So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. </p>
<p>Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. </p>
<p>There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. </p>
<p>The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. </p>
<p>Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mailpouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off. </p>
