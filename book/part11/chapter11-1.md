It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete (布尔戈特). 

People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. 

Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. 

When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. 

It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top. 

Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. 

A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. 

He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. 

He apologized and made me take another drink. 

He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. 

He was very good at it. The Basques (巴斯克人) liked it. 

The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. 

The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. 

When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. 

Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. 

They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills. 

Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. 

As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. 

The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. 

The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. 

He nodded his head. "Pretty nice, eh?" 

"These Basques are swell people," Bill said. 

The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddleleather. 

He wore a black smock like all the rest. 

There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. 

He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. 

The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. 

He shoved the wine-bag up. "Arriba! Arriba! (西语，举起来！)" he said. "Lift it up." 

Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. 

When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin. 

"No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that." 

One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. 

He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms' length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. 

He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly. 

"Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?" 

The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. 

Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. 

He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly. 

We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. 

Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. 

We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. 

The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. 

The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. 

The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. 

Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. 

We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. 

The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. 

Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. 

This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero (西语，赶骡人) driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. 

Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain. 

We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. 

A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses. 

The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. 

Bill and I got down and went into the posada. 

There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, 

and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. 

It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. 

Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods. 

We each had an aguardiente (土酿白兰地) and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. 

I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price. 

Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. 

So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. 

Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. 

There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. 

The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. 

Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mailpouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.
