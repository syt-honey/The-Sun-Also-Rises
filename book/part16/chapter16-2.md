I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. 

Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody. 

There was a lot of drunken talking. 

"Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer." 

Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her. 

"Go on. Tell him !" Bill said. 

Romero looked up smiling. 

"This gentleman," I said, "is a writer." 

Romero was impressed. 

"This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn. 

"He looks like Villalta," Romero said, looking at Bill. 

"Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?" 

"I can't see it," the critic said. 

"Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?" 
"Nothing." 

"Is that why he drinks?" 

"No. He's waiting to marry this lady." 

"Tell him bulls have no balls !" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table. 
"What does he say?" 

"He's drunk." 

"Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls !" 

"You understand?" I said. 

"Yes." 

I was sure he didn't, so it was all right. 

"Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants." 

"Pipe down, Mike." 

"Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants." 

"Pipe down." 

During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. 

Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing. 

Bill was filling the glasses. 

"Tell him Brett wants to come into — " 

"Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake !" 

Romero looked up smiling. 

"Pipe down ! I know that," he said. 

Just then Montoya came into the room. 

He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod. 

Montoya went out of the room. 

Mike was on his feet proposing a toast. 

"Let's all drink to — " he began. 

"Pedro Romero," I said. 

Everybody stood up. 

Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. 

But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together. 

"My God ! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn." 

"I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?" 

"Oh, shut up, Mike ! Nobody interrupted you." 

"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn !" 

"Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said. 

"Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?" 

"I said all I had to say the other night, Mike." 

"I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. 

"I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don't you think I'm right?" 

He looked at us. 

"Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the Irufla." 

"No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman." 

"Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said. 

"Don't you think I'm right, Jake?" 

Cohn still sat at the table. 

His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. 

The childish, drunken heroics of it. 

It was his affair with a lady of title. 

"Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you !" 

He turned to Cohn: "Go away ! Go away now !" 

"But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn. 

"Then I'll make you !" Mike started toward him around the table. 

Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. 

He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love. 

I grabbed Mike. "Come on to the café," I said. "You can't hit him here in the hotel." 
"Good !" said Mike. "Good idea !" 

We started off. 

I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again. 

Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador. 

Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing. 

Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. 
There was a wind blowing. 

The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. 

A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. 

Some fell into the crowd. 

The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. 

There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet. 

Brett came out with Bill and joined us. 

We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. 

The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people. 

The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell. 

"They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said. 

"How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said. 

"His name's on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad (西语，本城的焰火师)." 

"Globos illuminados (西语，照明气球，焰火气球)," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said." 

The wind blew the band music away. 

"I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious." 

"He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,' " Bill said. 

"Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados." 

"Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here." 

"Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said. 

"How you know things," Brett said. 

Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy. 

No one noticed us come in. 

We could not find a table. 

There was a great noise going on. 

"Come on, let's get out of here," Bill said. 

Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. 

There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables. 

Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. 

We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz. 

She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. 

The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed. 

"Here's the pub," Mike said. 

It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. 

We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. 

The bar was not full. 

There was nothing going on. 

"This is a hell of a place," Bill said. 

"It's too early." 

"Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want to sit here on a night like this." 

"Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English." 

"They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?" 

"They come from Biarritz," Mike said. "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta." 

"I'll fiesta them," Bill said. 

"You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?" 

"Come off it, Michael." 

"I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing. Have we met?" 

"Come along with me and Bill. We're going to fiesta the English." 

"I'll fiesta them," Bill said. "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?" 

"Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to fiesta the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English. I'm going to fiesta them. Come on, Bill."
