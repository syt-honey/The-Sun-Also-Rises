                                <p>We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. </p>
<p>They were all quiet now, their heads down. </p>
<p>We got a carriage outside and rode up to the caf&#xE9;. </p>
<p>Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks. 
We were sitting in the caf&#xE9;. </p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s an extraordinary business,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;Will those last ones fight as well as the first?&quot; Robert Cohn asked. </p>
<p>&quot;They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They all know each other,&quot; I said. &quot;They&apos;re only dangerous when they&apos;re alone, or only two or three of them together.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, dangerous?&quot; Bill said. &quot;They all looked dangerous to me.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They only want to kill when they&apos;re alone. Of course, if you went in there you&apos;d probably detach one of them from the herd, and he&apos;d be dangerous.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s too complicated,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Don&apos;t you ever detach me from the herd, Mike.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I say,&quot; Mike said, &quot;they were fine bulls, weren&apos;t they? Did you see their horns?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Did I not,&quot; said Brett. &quot;I had no idea what they were like.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Did you see the one hit that steer?&quot; Mike asked. &quot;That was extraordinary.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s no life being a steer,&quot; Robert Cohn said. </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think so?&quot; Mike said. &quot;I would have thought you&apos;d loved being a steer, Robert.&quot; 
&quot;What do you mean, Mike?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they&apos;re always hanging about so.&quot; </p>
<p>We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking. </p>
<p>&quot;I should think you&apos;d love it. You&apos;d never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don&apos;t just sit there.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I said something, Mike. Don&apos;t you remember? About the steers.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can&apos;t you see we&apos;re all having a good time here?&quot; 
&quot;Come off it, Michael. You&apos;re drunk,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m not drunk. I&apos;m quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? </p>
<p>&quot;Aren&apos;t the bulls lovely? Don&apos;t you like them, Bill? Why don&apos;t you say something, Robert? Don&apos;t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She&apos;s slept with lots of better people than you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; Cohn said. He stood up. &quot;Shut up, Mike.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won&apos;t make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know you&apos;re not wanted? I know when I&apos;m not wanted.Why don&apos;t you know when you&apos;re not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren&apos;t wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that&apos;s right?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Shut up. You&apos;re drunk.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren&apos;t you drunk? </p>
<p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn&apos;t have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. </p>
<p>&quot;You can&apos;t blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn&apos;t do it. You can&apos;t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go to hell, Mike.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I can&apos;t blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven&apos;t you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;re a splendid one to talk about manners,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;ve such lovely manners.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Robert,&quot; Bill said. </p>
<p>&quot;What do you follow her around for?&quot; Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn. </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t go,&quot; Mike said. &quot; Robert Cohn&apos;s going to buy a drink.&quot; </p>
<p>Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn&apos;s face was sallow. Mike went on talking. </p>
<p>I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted. </p>
<p>&quot;I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,&quot; she interrupted. </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m not saying he&apos;s not right, you know.&quot; She turned to me. </p>
<p>The emotion left Mike&apos;s voice. We were all friends together. </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m not so damn drunk as I sounded,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>&quot;I know you&apos;re not,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;re none of us sober,&quot; I said. </p>
<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say anything I didn&apos;t mean.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;But you put it so badly,&quot; Brett laughed. </p>
<p>&quot;He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn&apos;t wanted. </p>
<p>&quot;He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He did behave very badly,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;Mark you. Brett&apos;s had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn&apos;s letters to read. I wouldn&apos;t read them.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Damned noble of you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No, listen, Jake. Brett&apos;s gone off with men. But they weren&apos;t ever Jews, and they didn&apos;t come and hang about afterward.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Damned good chaps,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;She gave me Robert Cohn&apos;s letters. I wouldn&apos;t read them.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t read any letters, darling. You wouldn&apos;t read mine.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I can&apos;t read letters,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Funny, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You can&apos;t read anything.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. You&apos;re wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I&apos;m at home.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;ll be writing next,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Come on, Michael. Do buck up. </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;ve got to go through with this thing now. He&apos;s here. Don&apos;t spoil the fiesta.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, let him behave, then.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;ll behave. I&apos;ll tell him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;it would be nice for me to tell him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no. I can&apos;t.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go on. We&apos;re all friends. Aren&apos;t we all friends, Jake?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell him. It&apos;s too ridiculous.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You won&apos;t, Michael. Don&apos;t be an ass.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He calls her Circe,&quot; Mike said. &quot;He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;d be good, you know,&quot; Brett said. &quot;He writes a good letter.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said. &quot;He wrote me from San Sebastian.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That was nothing,&quot; Brett said. &quot;He can write a damned amusing letter.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I damned well was, too.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; I said, &quot;we must go in and eat.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How should I meet Cohn?&quot; Mike said. </p>
<p>&quot;Just act as though nothing had happened.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s quite all right with me,&quot; Mike said. &quot;I&apos;m not embarrassed.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;If he says anything, just say you were tight.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner.&quot; </p>
<p>We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the caf&#xE9;s under the arcades. </p>
<p>We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel. </p>
<p>They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, how did you like the bulls?&quot; he asked. </p>
<p>&quot;Good. They were nice bulls.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They&apos;re all right&quot; &#x2014; Montoya shook his head &#x2014; &quot;but they&apos;re not too good.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What didn&apos;t you like about them?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. They just didn&apos;t give me the feeling that they were so good.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They&apos;re all right.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. They&apos;re all right.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How did your friends like them?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Montoya said.I went up-stairs. </p>
<p>Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square. </p>
<p>I stood beside him. &quot;Where&apos;s Cohn?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Up-stairs in his room.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How does he feel?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He&apos;s terrible when he&apos;s tight.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He wasn&apos;t so tight.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The hell he wasn&apos;t. I know what we had before we came to the caf&#xE9;.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He sobered up afterward.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Good. He was terrible. I don&apos;t like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How&apos;d you like the bulls?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Grand. It&apos;s grand the way they bring them out.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow come the Miuras.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When does the fiesta start?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Day after to-morrow.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;d better get cleaned up for supper.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Won&apos;t it?&quot; </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. </p>
<p>Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. </p>
<p>Mike acted as though nothing had happened. </p>
<p>I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down. </p>
<p>He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally. 
He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy. </p>
<p>It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was Michael. They were good together. It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. </p>
<p>There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. </p>
<p>Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. </p>
<p>It seemed they were all such nice people. </p>
