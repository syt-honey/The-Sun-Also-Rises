                                <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t marry him if he doesn&apos;t want to. Of course I wouldn&apos;t. I wouldn&apos;t marry him now for anything. </p>
<p>&quot;But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we&apos;ve waited three years, and I&apos;ve just gotten my divorce.&quot; </p>
<p>I said nothing. &quot;We were going to celebrate so, and instead we&apos;ve just had scenes. It&apos;s so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can&apos;t do it.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s rotten luck.&quot; &quot;I should say it is rotten luck. I&apos;ve wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don&apos;t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. </p>
<p>Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes (&#x621B;&#x7EB3;). All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don&apos;t think I could get anybody.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sure, you could marry anybody.&quot; &quot;No, I don&apos;t believe it. And I&apos;m fond of him, too. And I&apos;d like to have children. I always thought we&apos;d have children.&quot; </p>
<p>She looked at me very brightly. &quot;I never liked children much, but I don&apos;t want to think I&apos;ll never have them. </p>
<p>I always thought I&apos;d have them and then like them.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s got children.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. He&apos;s got children, and he&apos;s got money, and he&apos;s got a rich mother, and he&apos;s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff, nobody at all. </p>
<p>It isn&apos;t bad, either. And I haven&apos;t got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.&quot; </p>
<p>She looked at me again very brightly. &quot;It isn&apos;t right. It&apos;s my own fault and it&apos;s not, too. </p>
<p>I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can&apos;t marry. </p>
<p>Why can&apos;t he marry? I&apos;d be a good wife. I&apos;m easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn&apos;t do any good.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s a rotten shame.&quot; &quot;Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there&apos;s no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let&apos;s go back to the caf&#xE9;.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;And of course there isn&apos;t anything I can do.&quot; &quot;No. Just don&apos;t let him know I talked to you. </p>
<p>I know what he wants.&quot; Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. </p>
<p>&quot;He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That&apos;s what he wants.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they won&apos;t like it. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s that way. Really.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You don&apos;t know him like I do, Jake. That&apos;s what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. </p>
<p>That&apos;s why he doesn&apos;t want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Want to go back to the caf&#xE9;?&quot; &quot;Yes. Come on.&quot; </p>
<p>We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink-- and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, what are you smiling at?&quot; Frances asked him. &quot;Feel pretty happy?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, what I&apos;ve told Jake isn&apos;t any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What was it? About your going to England?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I&apos;m going to England.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that fine!&quot; &quot;Yes, that&apos;s the way it&apos;s done in the very best families. </p>
<p>Robert&apos;s sending me. He&apos;s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I&apos;m going to visit friends. </p>
<p>Won&apos;t it be lovely? The friends don&apos;t know about it, yet.&quot; </p>
<p>She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now. </p>
<p>&quot;You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren&apos;t you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. </p>
<p>He&apos;s really very generous. Aren&apos;t you, Robert?&quot; </p>
<p>I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. </p>
<p>There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. </p>
<p>They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. </p>
<p>But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later. </p>
<p>&quot;How can you say such things, Frances?&quot; Cohn interrupted. </p>
<p>&quot;Listen to him. I&apos;m going to England. I&apos;m going to visit friends. </p>
<p>Ever visit friends that didn&apos;t want you? Oh, they&apos;ll have to take me, all right. How do you do, my dear? </p>
<p>Such a long time since we&apos;ve seen you. And how is your dear mother? </p>
<p>&apos; Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. And what about Robert?&apos; </p>
<p>or else very careful talking around Robert. You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience. </p>
<p>Won&apos;t it be fun, Robert? Don&apos;t you think it will be fun, Jake?&quot; </p>
<p>She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this. </p>
<p>&quot;And where are you going to be, Robert? It&apos;s my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. </p>
<p>When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you&apos;d get rid of me the same way. </p>
<p>Jake doesn&apos;t know about that. Should I tell him?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, Frances, for God&apos;s sake.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. </p>
<p>Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. </p>
<p>So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn&apos;t even pay her fare back to the coast. </p>
<p>All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn&apos;t you, Robert? </p>
<p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. </p>
<p>And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. </p>
<p>Isn&apos;t that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren&apos;t you, Robert? That&apos;s why he&apos;s leaving me. He&apos;s decided I don&apos;t film well.&quot; </p>
<p>&#x201C;You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn&apos;t remember anything about us.&quot; </p>
<p>&#x201C;So now he&apos;s going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won&apos;t mind, will you? </p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&apos;t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can&apos;t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can&apos;t remember what the other person&apos;s said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;You&apos;ll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I know it&apos;s awfully hard. But remember, it&apos;s for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at me. I&apos;m going to England without a protest. All for literature. </p>
<p>&#x201C;We must all help young writers. Don&apos;t you think so, Jake? But you&apos;re not a young writer. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you, Robert? You&apos;re thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Robert doesn&apos;t think he&apos;s any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. </p>
<p>&#x201C;He doesn&apos;t read French very well himself. He wasn&apos;t a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? </p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn&apos;t marry them? </p>
<p>I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I&apos;ve just thought of something.&quot; </p>
<p>She put her gloved hand up to her lips. &quot;I know the real reason why Robert won&apos;t marry me, Jake. </p>
<p>&#x201C;It&apos;s just come to me. They&apos;ve sent it to me in a vision in the caf&#xE9; Select. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it mystic? Some day they&apos;ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes (&#x5362;&#x5C14;&#x5FB7;). Do you want to hear, Robert? </p>
<p>&#x201C;I&apos;ll tell you. It&apos;s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, you see, Robert&apos;s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn&apos;t marry me, why, then he&apos;s had one. </p>
<p>&#x201C;She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he&apos;s always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s bright of me to figure that out? It&apos;s true, too. Look at him and see if it&apos;s not. Where are you going, Jake?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.&quot; </p>
<p>Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that? </p>
<p>As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. </p>
<p>Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: &quot;Isn&apos;t it so, Robert?&quot; </p>
<p>Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. </p>
<p>I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. </p>
<p>As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. </p>
<p>She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail (&#x62C9;&#x65AF;&#x62DC;&#x5C14;&#x5927;&#x8857;). </p>
<p>A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat. </p>
