                                <p>In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a caf&#xE9;. </p>
<p>Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. </p>
<p>Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. </p>
<p>We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town. </p>
<p>I was not at all sure Mike&apos;s rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store. </p>
<p>The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back. </p>
<p>Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets. </p>
<p>We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. </p>
<p>Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. </p>
<p>It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. </p>
<p>Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d&apos;Initiative (&#x65C5;&#x6E38;&#x4E8B;&#x4E1A;&#x8054;&#x5408;&#x4F1A;) office, where the bus was supposed to start from. </p>
<p>There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July. </p>
<p>We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre (&#x5E02;&#x5267;&#x9662;) for four hundred francs. </p>
<p>The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the caf&#xE9; on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. </p>
<p>It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the caf&#xE9;. </p>
<p>A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. </p>
<p>There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the caf&#xE9;. </p>
<p>But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. </p>
<p>We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. </p>
<p>It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. </p>
<p>While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. </p>
<p>I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. </p>
<p>It was really an awfully clean hotel. </p>
<p>Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. </p>
<p>It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. </p>
<p>He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town. </p>
<p>We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. </p>
<p>We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. </p>
<p>In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean. </p>
<p>Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. </p>
<p>There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, </p>
<p>and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea. </p>
<p>You couldn&apos;t see the sea. It was too far away. </p>
<p>You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was. </p>
<p>We crossed the Spanish frontier. </p>
<p>There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches. </p>
<p>They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them. </p>
<p>There was a general store and inn on each side of the line. </p>
<p>The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. </p>
<p>Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well. </p>
<p>Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many. </p>
<p>I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn&apos;t care for it. </p>
<p>Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. </p>
<p>He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down. </p>
<p>The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain. </p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with the old one?&quot; I asked. </p>
<p>&quot;He hasn&apos;t got any passport.&quot; </p>
<p>I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me. </p>
<p>&quot;What will he do?&quot; I asked. </p>
<p>The guard spat in the dust. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;ll just wade across the stream.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do you have much smuggling?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;they go through.&quot; </p>
<p>The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. </p>
<p>We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. </p>
<p>For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col (&#x5C71;&#x5773;), the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. </p>
<p>There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. </p>
<p>The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. </p>
<p>We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. </p>
<p>Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. </p>
<p>We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, </p>
<p>and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes. </p>
<p>After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, </p>
<p>and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind. </p>
<p>I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head. </p>
<p>Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, </p>
<p>and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. </p>
<p>In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona. </p>
