                                <p>&quot;Do you, now?&quot; asked the count. &quot;Do you joke him?&quot; </p>
<p>Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes. </p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t joke him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;See,&quot; said the count. &quot;You don&apos;t joke him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;This is a hell of a dull talk,&quot; Brett said. &quot;How about some of that champagne?&quot; </p>
<p>The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. </p>
<p>&quot;It isn&apos;t cold, yet. You&apos;re always drinking, my dear. Why don&apos;t you just talk?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve talked too ruddy much. I&apos;ve talked myself all out to Jake.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Leave &apos;em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It is a very interesting system,&quot; the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. &quot;Still I would like to hear you talk some time.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t he a fool?&quot; Brett asked. &quot;Now,&quot; the count brought up a bottle. &quot;I think this is cool.&quot; </p>
<p>I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. </p>
<p>&quot;I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool.&quot; </p>
<p>He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses. </p>
<p>&quot;I say. You might open it,&quot; Brett suggested. &quot;Yes, my dear. Now I&apos;ll open it.&quot; </p>
<p>It was amazing champagne. </p>
<p>&quot;I say that is wine,&quot; Brett held up her glass. &quot;We ought to toast something. &apos;Here&apos;s to royalty.&apos;&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don&apos;t want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.&quot; </p>
<p>Brett&apos;s glass was empty. &quot;You ought to write a book on wines, count,&quot; I said. </p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Barnes,&quot; answered the count, &quot;all I want out of wines is to enjoy them.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s enjoy a little more of this,&quot; Brett pushed her glass forward. </p>
<p>The count poured very carefully. &quot;There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Drunk? Drunk?&quot; My dear, you are charming when you are drunk. &quot;Listen to the man.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Barnes,&quot; the count poured my glass full. &quot;She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You haven&apos;t been around much, have you?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Drink your wine,&quot; said Brett. &quot;We&apos;ve all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don&apos;t think I don&apos;t think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Of course you have, my dear,&quot; Brett said. &quot;I was only ragging.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I have been in seven wars and four revolutions,&quot; the count said. </p>
<p>&quot;Soldiering?&quot; Brett asked. &quot;Sometimes, my dear. </p>
<p>And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds? &quot;Let&apos;s have a look at them.&quot; </p>
<p>The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. </p>
<p>He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light. </p>
<p>&quot;You see them?&quot; Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. </p>
<p>&quot;See on the back where they come out.&quot; Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger. </p>
<p>&quot;I say. Those are something.&quot;Clean through.&quot; </p>
<p>The count was tucking in his shirt. </p>
<p>&quot;Where did you get those?&quot; I asked.&quot; In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What were you doing?&quot; asked Brett. &quot;Were you in the army?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I was on a business trip, my dear.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I told you he was one of us. Didn&apos;t I?&quot; Brett turned to me. &quot;I love you, count. You&apos;re a darling.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn&apos;t true.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t be an ass.&quot; You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well.Don&apos;t you find it like that?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Absolutely.&quot; I know,&quot; said the count. &quot;That is the secret. You must get to know the values.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t anything ever happen to your values?&quot; Brett asked. </p>
<p>&quot;No. Not any more. &quot;Never fall in love?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Always,&quot; said the count. &quot;I am always in love.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What does that do to your values?&quot; &quot;That, too, has got a place in my values.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You haven&apos;t any values. You&apos;re dead, that&apos;s all.&quot; &quot;No, my dear. You&apos;re not right. I&apos;m not dead at all.&quot; </p>
<p>We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen. </p>
<p>We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. </p>
<p>Food had an excellent place in the count&apos;s values. So did wine. </p>
<p>The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party. </p>
<p>&quot;Where would you like to go?&quot; asked the count after dinner. </p>
<p>We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home. </p>
<p>&quot;We might go up on the hill,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Haven&apos;t we had a splendid party?&quot; </p>
<p>The count was beaming. He was very happy. </p>
<p>&quot;You are very nice people,&quot; he said. He was smoking a cigar again. </p>
<p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you get married, you two?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We want to lead our own lives,&quot; I said. </p>
<p>&quot;We have our careers,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Come on. Let&apos;s get out of this.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Have another brandy,&quot; the count said. </p>
<p>&quot;Get it on the hill. &quot;No. Have it here where it is quiet.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You and your quiet,&quot; said Brett. &quot;What is it men feel about quiet?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We like it,&quot; said the count. &quot;Like you like noise, my dear.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Brett. &quot;Let&apos;s have one.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sommelier!&quot; the count called.&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What is the oldest brandy you have?&quot; Eighteen eleven, sir.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Bring us a bottle.&quot;I say. Don&apos;t be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Got many antiquities?&quot; I got a houseful.&quot; </p>
<p>Finally we went up to Montmartre (&#x8499;&#x9A6C;&#x7279;). Inside Zelli&apos;s it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. </p>
<p>The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move. </p>
<p>The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him. </p>
<p>&quot;Hahre you?&quot; &quot;Great.&quot; &quot;Thats good.&quot; He was all teeth and lips. </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;s a great friend of mine,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Damn good drummer.&quot; </p>
<p>The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.Then the music started again and we danced. </p>
<p>I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again. </p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s go over.&quot; Brett started toward the table. </p>
<p>The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd. </p>
<p>&quot;You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael&apos;s the best dancer I know.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;s splendid.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s got his points.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I like him,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m damned fond of him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to marry him,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Funny. I haven&apos;t thought about him for a week.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you write him?&quot; Not I. Never write letters.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll bet he writes to you.&quot; Rather. Damned good letters, too.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When are you going to get married?&quot; &quot;How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael&apos;s trying to get his mother to put up for it.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Could I help you?&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t be an ass. Michael&apos;s people have loads of money.&quot; </p>
<p>The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up. </p>
<p>&quot;Very nice,&quot; he said. &quot;You looked very, very nice.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you dance, count?&quot; I asked. &quot;No. I&apos;m too old.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come off it,&quot; Brett said. &quot;My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Splendid,&quot; Brett said. &quot;I&apos;ll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don&apos;t want to have him around.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He is rather hard.&quot;You know I think that boy&apos;s got a future. But personally I don&apos;t want him around.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Jake&apos;s rather the same way.&quot;He gives me the willys.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; the count shrugged his shoulders. &quot;About his future you can&apos;t ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on. Let&apos;s dance,&quot; Brett said.We danced. It was crowded and close. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, darling,&quot; Brett said, &quot;I&apos;m so miserable.&quot; </p>
<p>I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. </p>
<p>&quot;You were happy a minute ago.&quot; The drummer shouted: &quot;You can&apos;t two time--&quot; &quot;It&apos;s all gone.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know. I just feel terribly.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;. . . . . .&quot; the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks. </p>
<p>&quot;Want to go?&quot; I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. </p>
<p>&quot;. . . . . .&quot; the drummer sang softly.&quot;Let&apos;s go,&quot; said Brett. &quot;You don&apos;t mind.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;. . . . . .&quot; the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett. </p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room. </p>
<p>&quot;Brett wants to go,&quot; I said to the count. </p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;Does she? That&apos;s fine. You take the car. I&apos;m going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.&quot; </p>
<p>We shook hands. &quot;It was a wonderful time,&quot; I said. &quot;I wish you would let me get this.&quot; I took a note out of my pocket. </p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Barnes, don&apos;t be ridiculous,&quot; the count said. </p>
<p>Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. </p>
<p>As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel. </p>
<p>&quot;No, don&apos;t come up,&quot; she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched. </p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; No. Please. &quot;Good night, Brett,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m sorry you feel rotten.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won&apos;t see you again.&quot; We kissed standing at the door. </p>
<p>She pushed me away. We kissed again. &quot;Oh, don&apos;t!&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat. </p>
<p>I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: &quot;Good night, sir,&quot; and drove off. </p>
<p>I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed. </p>
