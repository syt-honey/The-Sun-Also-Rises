                                <p>As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. </p>
<p>She had some letters and a telegram. </p>
<p>&quot;Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Did she leave a card?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Was she with a friend of mine?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little &#x2014; &quot; </p>
<p>She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille ([&#x6CD5;]&#x548C;&#x853C;&#x53EF;&#x4EB2;). Last night I formed another idea of her. </p>
<p>&quot;But listen to what I tell you. She is tr&#xE9;s, tr&#xE9;s gentille ([&#x6CD5;]&#x975E;&#x5E38;&#x3001;&#x975E;&#x5E38;&#x548C;&#x853C;&#x53EF;&#x4EB2;). She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;They did not leave any word?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Send them up when they come.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu&apos;une, quelqu&apos;une ([&#x6CD5;]&#x9AD8;&#x8D35;&#x4EBA;&#x7269;&#xFF0C;&#x9AD8;&#x8D35;&#x4EBA;&#x7269;)!&quot; </p>
<p>The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. </p>
<p>Her life-work lay in the pelouse ([&#x6CD5;]&#x8349;&#x576A;), but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage ([&#x6CD5;]&#x8D5B;&#x9A6C;&#x9A91;&#x5E08;&#x7684;&#x4F53;&#x91CD;&#x8FC7;&#x78C5;&#x5904;), and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. </p>
<p>The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez ([&#x6CD5;]&#x5728;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x5BB6;&#x91CC;) Barnes. </p>
<p>One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings. </p>
<p>I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge. </p>
<p>The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. </p>
<p>I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. </p>
<p>I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. </p>
<p>It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses. </p>
<p>&quot;Hello, darling,&quot; said Brett. &quot;Aren&apos;t you going to let us in?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on. I was just bathing.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you the fortunate man. Bathing.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know whether you like flowers, sir,&quot; the count said, &quot;but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Here, give them to me.&quot; Brett took them. &quot;Get me some water in this, Jake.&quot; </p>
<p>I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table. </p>
<p>&quot;I say. We have had a day.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You don&apos;t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You were quite drunk, my dear,&quot; said the count. </p>
<p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t I, though? And the count&apos;s been a brick, absolutely.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;ve got hell&apos;s own drag with the concierge now.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t be a damned fool.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;His,&quot; she said, and nodded at the count. </p>
<p>&quot;I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;s wonderful,&quot; Brett said. &quot;He remembers everything that&apos;s happened.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;So do you, my dear.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Fancy,&quot; said Brett. &quot;Who&apos;d want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Rather.&quot; </p>
<p>While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. </p>
<p>I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. </p>
<p>Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed. </p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?&quot; </p>
<p>She kissed me coolly on the forehead. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Brett, I love you so much.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Darling,&quot; she said. Then: &quot;Do you want me to send him away?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. He&apos;s nice.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll send him away.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No, don&apos;t.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ll send him away.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You can&apos;t just like that.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Can&apos;t I, though? You stay here. He&apos;s mad about me, I tell you.&quot; </p>
<p>She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. </p>
<p>I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. </p>
<p>Brett came in and sat on the bed. &quot;Poor old darling.&quot; She stroked my head. </p>
<p>&quot;What did you say to him?&quot; I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her. </p>
<p>&quot;Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.&quot; </p>
<p>Then later: &quot;Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s better.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Lie quiet. He&apos;s gone to the other side of town.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t we live together, Brett? Couldn&apos;t we just live together?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;d just tromper ([&#x6CD5;]&#x6B3A;&#x9A97;&#xFF0C;&#x5BF9;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x4E0D;&#x5FE0;) you with everybody. You couldn&apos;t stand it.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I stand it now.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That would be different. It&apos;s my fault, Jake. It&apos;s the way I&apos;m made.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t we go off in the country for a while?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn&apos;t be any good. I&apos;ll go if you like. But I couldn&apos;t live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it rotten? There isn&apos;t any use my telling you I love you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You know I love you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s not talk. Talking&apos;s all bilge. I&apos;m going away from you, and then Michael&apos;s coming back.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Why are you going away?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Better for you. Better for me.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When are you going?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Soon as I can.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;San Sebastian.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Can&apos;t we go together?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. That would be a hell of an idea after we&apos;d just talked it out.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We never agreed.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you know as well as I do. Don&apos;t be obstinate, darling.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; I said. &quot;I know you&apos;re right. I&apos;m just low, and when I&apos;m low I talk like a fool.&quot; </p>
<p>I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up. </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t look like that, darling.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How do you want me to look?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t be a fool. I&apos;m going away to-morrow.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Didn&apos;t I say so? I am.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s have a drink, then. The count will be back.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. He should be back. You know he&apos;s extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him.&quot; </p>
<p>We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself. </p>
<p>There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count. </p>
<p>Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne. </p>
<p>&quot;Where should I have him put it, sir?&quot; asked the count. </p>
<p>&quot;In the kitchen,&quot; Brett said. &quot;Put it in there, Henry,&quot; the count motioned. </p>
<p>&quot;Now go down and get the ice.&quot; He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. </p>
<p>&quot;I think you&apos;ll find that&apos;s very good wine,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>&quot;I know we don&apos;t get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that&apos;s in the business.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you always have some one in the trade,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;This fellow raises the grapes. He&apos;s got thousands of acres of them.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s his name?&quot; asked Brett. &quot;Veuve Cliquot?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the count. &quot;Mumms. He&apos;s a baron.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful,&quot; said Brett. &quot;We all have titles. Why haven&apos;t you a title, Jake?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I assure you, sir,&quot; the count put his hand on my arm. &quot;It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s damned useful sometimes,&quot; Brett said. </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve never known it to do me any good.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You haven&apos;t used it properly. I&apos;ve had hell&apos;s own amount of credit on mine.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do sit down, count,&quot; I said. &quot;Let me take that stick.&quot; </p>
<p>The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gaslight. </p>
<p>She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. </p>
<p>She saw me notice it. &quot;I say, Jake, I don&apos;t want to ruin your rugs. Can&apos;t you give a chap an ash-tray?&quot; </p>
<p>I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. </p>
<p>&quot;Put two bottles in it, Henry,&quot; the count called. </p>
<p>&quot;Anything else, sir?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. Wait down in the car.&quot; </p>
<p>He turned to Brett and to me. &quot;We&apos;ll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;If you like,&quot; Brett said. &quot;I couldn&apos;t eat a thing.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I always like a good meal,&quot; said the count. </p>
<p>&quot;Should I bring the wine in, sir?&quot; asked the chauffeur. </p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Bring it in, Henry,&quot; said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. </p>
<p>&quot;Like to try a real American cigar?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;ll finish the cigarette.&quot; </p>
<p>He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain. </p>
<p>&quot;I like a cigar to really draw,&quot; said the count. &quot;Half the cigars you smoke don&apos;t draw.&quot; </p>
<p>He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. &quot;And when you&apos;re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won&apos;t have a title.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No. What a pity.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the count. </p>
<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need a title. You got class all over you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. Awfully decent of you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m not joking you,&quot; the count blew a cloud of smoke. &quot;You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That&apos;s all.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Nice of you,&quot; said Brett. &quot;Mummy would be pleased. Couldn&apos;t you write it out, and I&apos;ll send it in a letter to her.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;d tell her, too,&quot; said the count. &quot;I&apos;m not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That&apos;s what I always say.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;re right,&quot; Brett said. &quot;You&apos;re terribly right. I always joke people and I haven&apos;t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You don&apos;t joke him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s it.&quot; </p>
