                                <p>I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. </p>
<p>One card came from her from there. </p>
<p>It had a picture of the Concha (&#x8D1D;&#x58F3;&#x6E7E;), and said: &quot;Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT.&quot; </p>
<p>Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, </p>
<p>but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. </p>
<p>I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers. </p>
<p>Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn&apos;s troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, </p>
<p>there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June. </p>
<p>Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. </p>
<p>He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful. </p>
<p>There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights. </p>
<p>Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. </p>
<p>Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more. </p>
<p>We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna. </p>
<p>He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona (&#x6F58;&#x666E;&#x6D1B;&#x7EB3;). </p>
<p>He wrote that Vienna (&#x7EF4;&#x4E5F;&#x7EB3;) was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest (&#x5E03;&#x8FBE;&#x4F69;&#x65AF;): &quot;Jake, Budapest is wonderful.&quot; </p>
<p>Then I got a wire: &quot;Back on Monday. &quot;Monday evening he turned up at the flat. </p>
<p>I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags. </p>
<p>I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I hear you had a wonderful trip.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful,&quot; he said. &quot;Budapest is absolutely wonderful.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How about Vienna?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How do you mean?&quot; I was getting glasses and a siphon. </p>
<p>&quot;Tight, Jake. I was tight.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s strange. Better have a drink.&quot; </p>
<p>Bill rubbed his forehead. &quot;Remarkable thing,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t know how it happened. Suddenly it happened.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Last long?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Where did you go?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do anything else?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Not so sure. Possible.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go on. Tell me about it.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Can&apos;t remember. Tell you anything I could remember.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go on. Take that drink and remember.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Might remember a little,&quot; Bill said. </p>
<p>&quot;Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go on.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. </p>
<p>&quot;All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger&apos;d just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. </p>
<p>&quot;Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. </p>
<p>&quot;Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn&apos;t get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money. </p>
<p>&quot;Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Probably it wasn&apos;t you.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How&apos;d you come out?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. </p>
<p>&quot;Claimed nigger violated contract. Can&apos;t knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. &apos;My God, Mister Gorton,&apos; said nigger, &apos;didn&apos;t do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.&apos; &quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Did you get any money?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger&apos;s clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What became of the nigger?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Went back to Cologne (&#x79D1;&#x9686;). Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You probably did.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, anyway, let&apos;s eat,&quot; said Bill. &quot;Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Go on.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s eat.&quot; </p>
<p>We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening. </p>
<p>&quot;Where will we go?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Want to eat on the island?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot; </p>
<p>We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau (&#x4E39;&#x8D39;&#x5C14;-&#x7F57;&#x4EC0;&#x6D1B;&#x5927;&#x8857;) with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes. </p>
<p>&quot;I know who they are.&quot; Bill eyed the monument. &quot;Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don&apos;t try and fool me on Paris.&quot; </p>
<p>We went on. </p>
<p>&quot;Here&apos;s a taxidermist&apos;s,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; I said. &quot;You&apos;re pie-eyed.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Pretty nice stuffed dogs,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Certainly brighten up your flat.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Just one stuffed dog. I can take &apos;em or leave &apos;em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;ll get one on the way back.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault.&quot; </p>
<p>We went on. </p>
<p>&quot;How&apos;d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals.&quot; </p>
<p>We stopped and had a drink. </p>
<p>&quot;Certainly like to drink,&quot; Bill said. &quot;You ought to try it some times, Jake.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;re about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Where were you drinking?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George&apos;s a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;ll be daunted after about three more pernods.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I&apos;ll go off by myself. I&apos;m like a cat that way.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When did you see Harvey Stone?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted.Hadn&apos;t eaten for three days. Doesn&apos;t eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;s all right.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Splendid. Wish he wouldn&apos;t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;ll we do to-night?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t make any difference. Only let&apos;s not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn&apos;t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Nix,&quot; I said. &quot;We&apos;re going to have a regular meal.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Just a suggestion,&quot; said Bill. &quot;Want to start now?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it. </p>
<p>&quot;See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I&apos;m a nature-writer.&quot; </p>
<p>A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett. </p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful lady,&quot; said Bill. &quot;Going to kidnap us.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Hullo!&quot; Brett said. &quot;Hullo!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.&quot; </p>
<p>Brett smiled at Bill. &quot;I say I&apos;m just back. Haven&apos;t bathed even. Michael comes in to-night.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Good. Come on and eat with us, and we&apos;ll all go to meet him.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Must clean myself.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, rot! Come on.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Must bathe. He doesn&apos;t get in till nine.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Might do that. Now you&apos;re not talking rot.&quot; </p>
<p>We got in the taxi. The driver looked around. </p>
<p>&quot;Stop at the nearest bistro,&quot; I said. </p>
<p>&quot;We might as well go to the Closerie (Closerie des Lilas, &#x4E01;&#x9999;&#x56ED;&#x5496;&#x5561;&#x9986;),&quot; Brett said. &quot;I can&apos;t drink these rotten brandies.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Closerie des Lilas.&quot; </p>
<p>Brett turned to Bill. </p>
<p>&quot;Have you been in this pestilential city long?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Just got in to-day from Budapest.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How was Budapest?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Ask him about Vienna.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Vienna,&quot; said Bill, &quot;is a strange city.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Very much like Paris,&quot; Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes. </p>
<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Very much like Paris at this moment.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You have a good start.&quot; </p>
<p>Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod. </p>
